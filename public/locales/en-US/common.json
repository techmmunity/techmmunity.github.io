			"alessandroRamos": "The community is very welcoming, I was always afraid to ask questions in other communities for fear of being \"too stupid questions\", but at Techmmunity, people understand that nobody is born knowing, answer even the stupid questions without making fun of whoever is asking. It's cool to be able to ask questions without fear.",
			"diegoPinheiro": "I have been to several technology communities to seek interaction to share experiences, but none of them met my expectations like the Techmmunity. Organized and with a visionary sense, Techmmunity seeks to integrate people from different areas to produce knowledge and add value in the form of projects, thus enabling better qualifications to obtain a solid position in the job market.",
